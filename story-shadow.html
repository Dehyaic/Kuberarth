  <h1>Shadow on the Hill - Diary of the Radiant One's Paladin </h1>

  <p>
    The dust of the path clung to my boots, every step up the hill heavier than the last. My tabard, marked with the sigil of the Radiant One, fluttered in the wind like it still held conviction I no longer carried.

"Radiant One, guide me," I whispered under my breath, though the words felt hollow now. Empty syllables. I had spoken them since childhood, like everyone of my kin — prayers woven into lullabies, sermons into our first lessons. We never doubted. Never asked.

But something was wrong.

The higher I climbed, the sharper the silence became. Birds no longer sang. The air thinned. My faith was supposed to grow stronger here, closer to the peak, closer to Him. Instead, unease coiled tighter around my chest.

I gripped my sword hilt for comfort. The blade had struck down monsters, shielded innocents — all in His name. Had it truly been His name? Or… no name at all?

A shadow stretched across the slope before me, though no clouds stirred above. It leaned long, crooked, almost human, yet bent in unnatural angles. I froze, watching it writhe as though alive.

“Radiant One?” My voice cracked, betraying me. “Is this… your test?”

No answer. Just the shifting shadow, beckoning toward the summit.

My stomach twisted. Every teaching, every hymn, every oath — were they lies? Were we all fools praying into the void?

And yet, I climbed still. Because if I turned back now, if I let fear rule me, then the emptiness in my prayers would win.

And I had to know.

Even if the answer broke me.
  </p>

  <p>
    The trees broke at last, giving way to an open slope where the peak loomed closer than it should. I blinked, shook my head. The hill stretched impossibly tall now, its crown lost in a veil of gray haze. Each step I took dragged at my bones, as though the earth itself pulled me deeper, not higher.

The hymns I once knew scattered in my memory like frightened birds. My lips moved, but no words came.

That shadow still preceded me — twisting, lengthening, bending into shapes that resembled figures. Faces. Arms. Victims.

And then I felt it.
Not wind. Not cold.
But a presence, brushing against my thoughts. Whispering where my prayers used to echo.

"Little pilgrim…"

The voice was soft, feminine. Sweet in tone, yet honey hiding poison. My knees weakened.

"How far you’ve walked for a god who has never answered you. Did you not notice? The silence? The absence? All those years, you prayed to nothing at all. But I have listened. Always."

I clutched my sword, though it suddenly felt like tin in my hand. “Who speaks? Show yourself!”

From the haze at the summit, the shadow uncoiled, rising tall and elegant, a shape half-woman, half-nightmare. Her robes fluttered as though underwater, and her eyes burned with fractured crimson light.

"An Âni," she said, almost proudly, her voice vibrating through my skull. "Pure once. Now perfected. Guisnow gave me truth, when your false Radiant gave you only chains."

I staggered back, but the ground beneath me shifted like soft sand, dragging me forward. No escape.

Her hand extended — long fingers ending in tips of ink.
"Come. Lay down your burden. Sleep. Dream. You will never hunger, never fear, never question again. I will keep you here, my faithful one."

I felt it then — the pull. My eyelids heavy. My heart slowing. The path itself had become a snare, dragging me into her eternal dream.

And yet… even as the weight bore down on me, a stubborn ember flared in my chest. Maybe it was faith, or pride, or just refusal to be a pawn. My sword quivered in my grip.

I whispered, to myself more than anyone:
"If my god is false… then I will make my own light."
  </p>

  <p>
   The shadow’s hand brushed closer, and I raised my sword, letting out a roar that clawed its way from my chest. The weight on my body tried to crush me, but I refused.

“For the Radiant! For truth!”

Steel met shadow. Light — or something that looked like light — burst from my strike. The Shadow on the Hill shrieked, recoiling, her form scattering into ribbons of black smoke. The ground trembled beneath me, the haze tearing open to show the summit.

Step by step, bleeding, shaking, I climbed.
The whispers clawed at my mind. Promises of rest. Lies of peace. But I pressed on.

Finally, on the peak, I raised my blade one last time. A surge of brilliance — whether born of god, or my will alone — cleaved through the sky. The shadow dissolved into nothing, ripped apart by the blaze.

I dropped to my knees, exhausted but triumphant. My chest heaved, my body broken, but I smiled through the pain.

I had won.

The hill was mine. My god was real. My pilgrimage complete.

I let my eyes close. Just for a moment. Just to rest.

And the hill sighed.

The "victory" flickered away like smoke. The shadow reassembled, untouched, gazing down with a smile sharp as glass. The paladin’s body lay crumpled at the base of the summit, eyes closed, lips curved in a peaceful grin. Dreaming. Forever.

Around the roots of the hill, the soil shifted, opening to embrace a new husk. His lifeforce seeped like honey into the roots, feeding the shadow’s veins.

Another pilgrim.
Another candle snuffed.
Another eternal dreamer added to the hill’s collection.

The Shadow on the Hill whispered softly, almost fondly:

"So faithful. So blind. Sleep now, little knight. Your light will keep me warm."

And above, the fog thickened, hiding the path once more, waiting for the next hapless soul with faith strong enough to carry them straight into her grasp.
